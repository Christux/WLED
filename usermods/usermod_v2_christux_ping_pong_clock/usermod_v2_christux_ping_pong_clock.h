/*
 * Usermods allow you to add own functionality to WLED more easily
 * See: https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/Add-own-functionality
 * 
 * This is an example for a v2 usermod.
 * v2 usermods are class inheritance based and can (but don't have to) implement more functions, each of them is shown in this example.
 * Multiple v2 usermods can be added to one compilation easily.
 * 
 * Creating a usermod:
 * This file serves as an example. If you want to create a usermod, it is recommended to use usermod_v2_empty.h from the usermods folder as a template.
 * Please remember to rename the class and file to a descriptive name.
 * You may also use multiple .h and .cpp files.
 * 
 * Using a usermod:
 * 1. Copy the usermod into the sketch folder (same folder as wled00.ino)
 * 2. Register the usermod by adding #include "usermod_filename.h" in the top and registerUsermod(new MyUsermodClass()) in the bottom of usermods_list.cpp

     * addToConfig() can be used to add custom persistent settings to the cfg.json file in the "um" (usermod) object.
     * It will be called by WLED when settings are actually saved (for example, LED settings are saved)
     * If you want to force saving the current state, use serializeConfig() in your loop().
     * 
     * CAUTION: serializeConfig() will initiate a filesystem write operation.
     * It might cause the LEDs to stutter and will cause flash wear if called too often.
     * Use it sparingly and always in the loop, never in network callbacks!
     * 
     * addToConfig() will make your settings editable through the Usermod Settings page automatically.
     *
     * Usermod Settings Overview:
     * - Numeric values are treated as floats in the browser.
     *   - If the numeric value entered into the browser contains a decimal point, it will be parsed as a C float
     *     before being returned to the Usermod.  The float data type has only 6-7 decimal digits of precision, and
     *     doubles are not supported, numbers will be rounded to the nearest float value when being parsed.
     *     The range accepted by the input field is +/- 1.175494351e-38 to +/- 3.402823466e+38.
     *   - If the numeric value entered into the browser doesn't contain a decimal point, it will be parsed as a
     *     C int32_t (range: -2147483648 to 2147483647) before being returned to the usermod.
     *     Overflows or underflows are truncated to the max/min value for an int32_t, and again truncated to the type
     *     used in the Usermod when reading the value from ArduinoJson.
     * - Pin values can be treated differently from an integer value by using the key name "pin"
     *   - "pin" can contain a single or array of integer values
     *   - On the Usermod Settings page there is simple checking for pin conflicts and warnings for special pins
     *     - Red color indicates a conflict.  Yellow color indicates a pin with a warning (e.g. an input-only pin)
     *   - Tip: use int8_t to store the pin value in the Usermod, so a -1 value (pin not set) can be used
     *
     * See usermod_v2_auto_save.h for an example that saves Flash space by reusing ArduinoJson key name strings
     * 
     * If you need a dedicated settings page with custom layout for your Usermod, that takes a lot more work.  
     * You will have to add the setting to the HTML, xml.cpp and set.cpp manually.
     * See the WLED Soundreactive fork (code and wiki) for reference.  https://github.com/atuline/WLED
     * 
     * I highly recommend checking out the basics of ArduinoJson serialization and deserialization in order to use custom settings!
